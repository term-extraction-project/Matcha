In 2022, crypto hit a new level of mainstream awareness, for better or worse. Coming off the highs of a 2021 bull run where Bitcoin topped $69,000, we end the year with fewer players and many lessons for us all. Despite the ups and downs, Blockchain.com’s long-term vision remains focused on the users — so we decided to ask how they’re feeling. 

Blockchain.com polled consumer crypto investors to gain insight regarding their thoughts and opinions in an inaugural poll, ‘Crypto Confidence: A Survey on Investor Sentiment.’ The survey focused on crypto usage and sentiment leading into the holiday season and the new year. 

More than 40,000 respondents from around the world painted a picture of cautious optimism. Despite Crypto Winter, 40% of respondents purchased crypto this year and also plan to do so in 2023, demonstrating that many investors remain measured but bullish. In addition, nearly 40% of respondents say they will discuss crypto around the holiday table this season, a clear indication that crypto has hit mainstream awareness. 

Overall results include: 

41% purchased crypto this year 

Nearly 40% plan to purchase crypto next year
